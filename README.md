Blockchain-based eCommerce warranty system using NFTs
The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure
authenticity and security. <br>
● Converting ownership authenticity and product warranty cards into decaying NFTs.📉<br>
● For instance, allow brands and retailers to introduce an NFT for each of their products, which allows customers to receive the physical product along with a digital version of it.🚀<br>
● Customers can then use the digital NFT to verify the authenticity of their product, prove their ownership of their product, and transfer ownership of them upon resale.🎯<br>
● The brand/retailer should also be able to tie the digital NFT to its warranty program, allowing owners to trackrepairs and replacements to the original item.🤩<br>
● Decay the NFT once the warranty is over.🥸<br>
● WE used the Polygon blockchain to deploy our solution and demo the final product as a web prototype🔗<br>
